# Acinetobacer baumannii Enamine REAL screening
Screening the Enamine REAL database against a series of Acinetobacter baumannii activity prediction models

## Background

### Data collection

Data consists of _Acinetobacter baumannii_ screening data collected from ChEMBL, Co-ADD and Spark. Datasets are binarized (i.e. active/inactive). We have used the following repositories to collect these datasets:

- [chembl-binary-tasks](https://github.com/ersilia-os/chembl-binary-tasks): Datasets collected from ChEMBL.
- [coadd-binary-tasks](https://github.com/ersilia-os/coadd-binary-tasks): Datasets extracted from Co-ADD and Spark (note that Spark is available through the Co-ADD web portal)

### In-house training procedure



### Other models and screening tools

#### From the Ersilia Model Hub

* [eos3804](https://github.com/ersilia-os/eos3804): Third party _Acinetobacter baumannii_ bioactivity prediction model.
* [eos42ez](https://github.com/ersilia-os/eos42ez): Cytotoxicity prediction, originally developed for an AMR screening.
* [eos74km](https://github.com/ersilia-os/eos74km): Broadly predicts whether compounds are active against gram-negative bacteria.
