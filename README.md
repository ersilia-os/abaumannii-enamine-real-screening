# Acinetobacer baumannii Enamine REAL screening
Screening the Enamine REAL database against a series of Acinetobacter baumannii activity prediction models

## Background

### Data collection

Data consists of _Acinetobacter baumannii_ screening data collected from ChEMBL, Co-ADD and Spark. Datasets are binarized (i.e. active/inactive). We have used the following repositories to collect these datasets:

- [chembl-binary-tasks](https://github.com/ersilia-os/chembl-binary-tasks): Datasets collected from ChEMBL.
- [coadd-binary-tasks](https://github.com/ersilia-os/coadd-binary-tasks): Datasets extracted from Co-ADD and Spark (note that Spark is available through the Co-ADD web portal)

### In-house training procedure



### Other models and screening tools


### Prediction pipeline
